KDB Manager                                                  April 15, 2005
===========================================================================
Version 1.1.0


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

KDB Manager is a simple GUI program for working with KitServer 4 KDB 
(Kits Database). It simplifies the task of defining kit attributes, such as
the colours of player name and number on the back of the shirt, colour of
the number on shorts, collar type, 3D-model of the shirt, cuffs type,
number type, name type(font), name shape (plain or curved), and the 
location of the number on shorts. 

KDB Manager will modify (and create, if necessary) the corresponding 
"attrib.cfg" files. (Note that you need KitServer 4.3.9 or later in order
to see the effect of some attributes.)


2. USAGE
--------------------

Run kdbManager.exe. When run first time, it will ask you to select the
location of your "KDB" folder. After that it should show a directory-like
tree on the left side which enumerates all the kits in the KDB. You can
select a kit file there and set/modify attributes in the right panel.
